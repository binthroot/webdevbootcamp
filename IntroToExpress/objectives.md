#Express App

* Review an existing app
* Review HTTP response/request lifecycle
    * we have get request at certain pages that render other pages
    * we have post request that create database objects
* Routes are import
    * how we listen to request and use particular code

* Package.json contain metadata on the package
    *  Dependencies in json tell us all the dependencies so we can download them later
*  why the --save flag
    * save flag changes our packages.json dependencies for future users and documentation

* Routes
    * using patterns for routes rather than writing each one numerous times
    * we use path variables in our get and post request (using a colon for our variables)
* Post routes
